        <p> Hello! My name is David Kariuki, and I am a passionate and creative individual with a strong interest in technology and design. 
            I love building websites, solving problems, and continuously learning new skills to improve my craft. 
            My journey in web development started with HTML and CSS, and I am currently exploring JavaScript to enhance my projects. 
            Beyond coding, I enjoy photography, design, and collaborating on exciting projects. 
            I am always eager to take on new challenges and bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
